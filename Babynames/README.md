## Babynames

For each year from 1880 to 2017, the data contains the number of children of each sex given each name. All names with more than 5 uses are given (Source: http://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html). We are using the package "babynames" to get familiar with time series plots.

I try to explore:
- Plot the most common names in 2017 over the entire period.
- Explore which names are most often used as unisex names. For which names has the popularity over time changed a lot?
- Identify one particular pattern in the data.
