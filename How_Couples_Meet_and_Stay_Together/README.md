## How Couples Meet and Stay Together

I analyze some data from an [extensive survey conducted by a researcher at Stanford University](https://data.stanford.edu/hcmst) to understand how couples meet and stay together.

I try to explore:
- Dating trends over time: how the mode of meeting for the first time has changed over the years.
- The relationship between a respondent’s age and their partner’s age, accounting for the gender of the respondent.
- Politics and Dating: the relationship between political party affiliation of the survey respondent and their meeting type / relationship duration time.
- The relationship between gender of respondents and partner income disparity.
- The relationship between the gender of respondents and the number of times they have been married.
- Interactivity: make two plots interactive and create a Data Table
